# Feature Selection for Machine Learning

***This repository contains the code for three main methods in Machine Learning for Feature Selection i.e. Filter Methods, Wrapper Methods and Embedded Methods. All code is written in Python 3.***

# Requirements

**1. Python 3.5 +**

**2. Jupyter Notebook**

**3. Scikit-Learn**

**4. Numpy [+mkl for Windows]**

**5. Pandas**

**6. Matplotlib**

**7. Seaborn**

# Datasets

**1.** [Santander Customer Satisfaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction)

**2.** [BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management)

# Filter Methods

| S.No. |       Name        |                           About                                    |    Status    |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
|  1.   | Constant Feature Elimination | This notebook explains how to remove the constant features during pre-processing step. | Completed |
|  2.   | Quasi-Constant Feature Elimination | This notebook explains how to get the Quasi-Constant features and remove them during pre-processing. | Completed |
|  3.   | Duplicate Features | This notebook explains how to find the duplicate features in a dataset and remove them. | Completed |
|  4.   | Correlation       | This notebook explains how to get the correlation between features and between features and target and choose the best features. | Completed |
|  5.   | Machine Learning Pipeline | This notebook explains how to use all the above methods in a ML pipeline with performance comparison. | Completed |


# Wrapper Methods

| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |

# Embedded Methods

| S.No. |       Name        |                           About                                    |    Status    |
